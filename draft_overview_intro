Overview
We are designing and evaluating an Epic-integrated SmartForm with real-time, point-based clinical decision support (CDS) to standardize pediatric headache care and reduce unnecessary expedited neurology referrals across CHOP primary care. Deployed on April 4, 2025 across 32 sites, the tool embeds pathway-aligned prompts, ActLinks/Hyperlinks, and SmartLists tied to ordersets/referrals to streamline documentation and decision-making. Our goal is to demonstrate improved pathway adherence, higher CDS acceptance, and better downstream outcomes (e.g., fewer avoidable ED or expedited neurology visits)

Introduction

Problem, significance, background. Headache is a frequent pediatric complaint in primary care, yet documentation of key features and management steps is often inconsistent, impeding triage quality and research/quality improvement efforts. Initial work began with a primary-care headache pathway (Oct 2023) and a .PCEnhancedHPI SmartPhrase (2024); under the Possibilities Project Team, this evolved into a SmartForm that captures discrete data and embeds weighted point-system CDS, with CER rules (e.g., automatic selection for “≤6 years”) and direct links to ordersets and neurology referral workflows. This transformation aims to reduce referral variability and support appropriate, pathway-concordant care.
Interdisciplinary context. The project sits at the intersection of clinical informatics, primary care pediatrics/neurology, HCI/UX, and data science/quality analytics. Informatics and Epic build expertise shaped the SmartForm/CDS design; clinician input defined data elements and thresholds; and QI/analytics methods will evaluate outcomes and provider behavior (adoption, acceptance). By unifying structured capture with workflow-embedded guidance, the tool targets both process (adherence, documentation completeness) and outcomes (referral appropriateness, ED utilization).
